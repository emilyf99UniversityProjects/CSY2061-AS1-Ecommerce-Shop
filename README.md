## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Two of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY2061 - Mobile Application 1 and was an assessment of the student's ability to learn the basics of Android Studio, and how they apply the previous year's Java knowledge to developing basic Mobile Applications.

This project was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% is uploaded in a separate repository under the same module name.

The main aim of this project was to show the author's understanding of activities and string manipulation. To present a simulation of an E-Commerce Application.
While marks were given for UI the assessment did not ask for a well-designed UI due to the 3 Day exam time constraints. This is why the app is skeleton-like in its appearance.
